This app adds support for Sensative Strips in Homey.

Release notes
-------------
**1.0.3:**
* Z-Wave configuration parameters should be properly initialized upon inclusion now.
* Requires Homey 1.0.3 firmware due to an issue in combination with 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 firmwares.

**1.0.1:**
* In this initial version, Strips will be set to a simple binary sensor. I'd like to switch to using its default operating mode in the future, which may require the device to be re-added.
* The US version of Strips is not yet recognized. It may be added in a future version (testers needed).
